# Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.
Linear Regression is usually the first machine learning algorithm that every data scientist comes across. It is a simple model but everyone needs to master it as it lays the foundation for other machine learning algorithms.
It is a very powerful technique and can be used to understand the factors that influence profitability. It can be used to forecast sales in the coming months by analyzing the sales data for previous months. It can also be used to gain various insights about customer behaviour. By the end of the blog we will build a model which looks like the below picture i.e, determine a line which best fits the data.


# Simple Linear Regression

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
The line for which the the error between the predicted values and the observed values is minimum is called the best fit line or the regression line. These errors are also called as residuals. The residuals can be visualized by the vertical lines from the observed data value to the regression line
The objective of a linear regression model is to find a relationship between one or more features(independent variables) and a continuous target variable(dependent variable). When there is only feature it is called Uni-variate Linear Regression and if there are multiple features, it is called Multiple Linear Regression.

Linear regression is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables.
